### What I Learned 

In this project, I learned how to properly organize my code with the use of ES6 Modules, allowing me to enhance the cleanliness and readability of my code. In addition, I also learned how to efficiently bundle these modules using webpacks. Learning these technologies has opened up a plethora of oppurtunities in terms of what I can now construct and build with Javascript.
